# Collection Log Guide

## What is the Collection Log?

The Collection Log is your photo-based bucket list of life experiences! Unlike quests (which you do regularly), collection log entries are unique experiences you want to capture and remember.

## How It Works

### 1. Add an Experience
Click "📸 Collection Log" from your Character Sheet or "+ Add Experience" in the Collection Log view.

Fill out:
- **Title**: What's the experience? (e.g., "Date night at The French Laundry")
- **Description** (optional): Add details or context
- **Tags**: Categorize it (e.g., date-night, food, friends, travel)

The entry is saved but **not completed** yet - it's waiting for you to do it!

### 2. Complete It With a Photo
When you have the experience, click "📸 Complete with Photo" on the card:
- Take a photo or upload one
- The photo is required - collection logs MUST have a photo
- Once saved, the entry is marked complete ✓

### 3. Track Your Progress
- See completion stats at the top
- Filter by status (All / To Complete / Completed)
- Filter by tags to find specific types of experiences
- Completed entries show a green checkmark and border

## Tips for Using Collection Log

1. **Add entries proactively** - When you think "I want to do that someday," add it to the log immediately

2. **Be specific** - "Date night with Scott at The French Laundry" is better than "Nice dinner"

3. **Use consistent tags** - The app learns your tags and shows them as filter buttons

4. **Don't overthink it** - Add experiences you genuinely want to photograph and remember

5. **Mix planned and spontaneous** - Some entries are goals, others are "oh this is happening, let me log it!"

6. **Tags can overlap with Paths** - "Make an art piece and share it online" could be tagged: art, artistic-visionary, social-media
